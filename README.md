# React movie search app

Link: https://wweiyang.github.io/movie-search-app/

An app for searching movies. This project was for learning about React functional components, how to retrieve data from an API using Javascript async/await, and how to use React useState Hook.

## Overall process of the project:

- Build searchMovies component
- Style searchMovies component
- Add state with React useState Hook
- Fetch movie data from API
- Build movieCard component
- Style movieCard component
- Deploy to Github Pages

This project was good practise for getting used to React, and helped to introduce the concept of making components modular, even for a simple app like this.

For deployment, Github Pages works for a simple React app like this. However, if it were to get more complex, then using an alternative like Netlify to host it would be better (like for the Netflik project), since Github Pages doesnâ€™t work well with React Router.

## Technologies overview:

- React
- Functional components
- CSS
- The Movie Database API
